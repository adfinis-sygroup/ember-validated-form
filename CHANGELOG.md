## [1.1.0]

### Changed

- Update ember-cli to 3.0.0, update dependencies

## [1.0.1]

### Changed

- fix: use radio value to expose option key (#91, credits to @makepanic)

## [1.0.0]

### Changed

- Install `ember-changeset` and `ember-changeset-validations` from the blueprint (#86, credits to @bendemboski)
- Update dependencies (#87, credits to @bendemboski)
- Remove deprecated task support (#88, credits to @bendemboski)

The 1.0.0 release removes ember-changeset and ember-changeset-validations as dependencies because this addon is built to make them very easy to use, but doesn't require them. So if you are using either or both of them in your application code but do not already have them in your package.json, you should run

```bash
ember install ember-changeset
ember install ember-changeset-validations
```

This release also removes the previously deprecated API for passing ember-concourrency tasks to `on-submit`. Please see section [0.6.2] for migration instructions.

## [0.7.1]

### Changed

## [0.6.3]

### Changed

## [0.6.2]

### Changed

- Yield loading state, change `on-submit` to promise semantics (#75, credits to @bendemboski)

This release deprecates passing an ember-concurrency task directly to `on-submit`:

```Handlebars
// deprecated:
{{#validated-form on-submit = myTask (...)}}
```

Instead, `on-submit` accepts a promise - which is returned by wrapping the task in `perform`:

```Handlebars
{{#validated-form on-submit = (perform myTask) (...)}}
```

## [0.6.1]

### Added

- Add more input attributes (#71, credits to @bendemboski)
- Add validateBeforeSubmit option (#70, credits to @bendemboski)

## [0.6.0]

### Changed

- Use yarn instead of npm (#62)
- Update dependencies (#62)
- Remove automatic disabling of submit button while task is running (#63)

To restore the old behaviour, all you have to do is pass the `isRunning` state as `disabled` property to the submit button:

```Handlebars
{{#validated-form
  ...
  on-submit = myTask
  as |f|}}
  {{f.submit label="Test" disabled=myTask.isRunning}}
{{/validated-form}}
```

### Added

- Add loading class to button if task is running (#63)
- Support block style usage of submit button (#61)

### Removed

- Useless class name binding on button (#65)
- Dependency to ember-data (#62)
- Various unused dependencies (#62)

## [0.5.4]

- Dummy app: load bootstrap from CDN (#59)

## [0.5.3]

  the same name (#55, credits to @anehx)

## [0.5.2]

- Update ember-cli to v2.5.1 (#53)

### Changed

## [0.5.0]

### Changed

- Separate classes for field hints and validation messages (#42, credits to @jacob-financit). If you've
  been using the (previously undocumented) option `help` on input fields, you'll have to rename them to `hint`.

## [0.4.2]

### Changed

## [0.4.0]

## [0.3.1]

### Added

- More CSS configuration options and docs on how to integrate semantic UI (#26)

## [0.3.0]

### Changed

- Removed automatic inference if field is required (which appended "\*" to labels) because it
  was incorrect. (#27, credits to @andreabettich) Now, fields have to be marked as required explicitly:

```Handlebars
{{f.input label="First name" name="firstName" required=true}}
```

## [0.2.2]

- Upgrade to ember 2.12.0 (#24, credits to @sproj)

## [0.2.1]

### Added

- Override initial value of input field using `value` attribute (#22, credits to @kaldras)
- Document `on-update` property for custom update functions of input elements,
  and add `changeset` argument to its signature

## [0.2.0]

### Changed

- yield `submit` button instead of automatically rendering it, removed `cancel` button. Migration is simple:

Before:

```Handlebars
{{#validated-form
  model        = (changeset model UserValidations)
  on-submit    = (action "submit")
  on-cancel    = (action "cancel")
  submit-label = 'Save' as |f|}}
  {{!-- form content --}}
{{/validated-form}}
```

After:

```Handlebars
{{#validated-form
  model        = (changeset model UserValidations)
  on-submit    = (action "submit")
  as |f|}}
  {{!-- form content --}}
  {{f.submit label='Save'}}
  <button {{action="cancel"}}>Cancel</button>
{{/validated-form}}
```
